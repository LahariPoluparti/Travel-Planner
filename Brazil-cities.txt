Salvador	2700000	Pupusa	San Salvador, the capital of El Salvador, is the second largest city in Central America (after Guatemala City in Guatemala), home to an entire third of the El Salvador population. As a result, San Salvador contains affluent suburbs as well as slums, representing the discrepancy in the country's distribution of wealth. Still recovering in many ways from an extended history of violence, San Salvador can be sprawling, grimy and chaotic. But once compromising first impressions are set aside, many travelers will discover San Salvador's other side: friendly, globe-conscious, cultured -- even sophisticated.	Tropical climate
