Munich	1472000	Sauerkraut	Munich (München in German) is the capital city of the German state of Bavaria. It lies only about 30 miles north of the Bavarian Alps and is home to about 1.5 million residents (2018). The earliest records mentioning Munich date back to 1158. Munich got its start and its name as a stop along the Salt Route (Salzstraße) at a toll bridge (where the Ludwig’s Bridge is today) that crossed the Isar River near the site of a Benedictine monastery. The city’s German name, München, is derived from the word Mönch (munich in Old High German), which means monk. A monk is also depicted on the city’s coat of arms. Munich was officially chartered as a city in 1175.	Temperate, Marine		
Berlin	3769000	Wiener Schnitzel	Berlin, the German capital, is renowned for its exceptional variety of attractions, its flourishing cultural scene and a way of life that's both fast-paced and relaxed. Contrasts between historical buildings and modern architecture, between the traditional and the modern are what set the city apart from the rest. The sights of Berlin – from the Brandenburg Gate to the Federal Chancellery – tell the story of an entire nation. Germany's capital is home to all the major goverment buildings, most notably the historic Reichstag, seat of the German parliament.	Temperate, Marine	
Frankfurt	753056	Frankfurter Rippchen	Frankfurt am Main is the largest city in the German state of Hesse (Hessen in German), but not the capital, which is nearby Wiesbaden. Frankfurt lies on the banks of the river Main (pron. mine). The city’s full name, Frankfurt am Main (“Frankfurt on the Main”), distinguishes it from the other, smaller Frankfurt on the Oder river (Frankfurt an der Oder) on the Polish border. Frankfurt am Main has about 753,000 residents (2018), but the greater Rhein-Main metro region is home to over five million people.	Temperate, Marine
